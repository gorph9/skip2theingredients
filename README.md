skip2theingredients is a public kitchen built from static and smoke —
a recipe mainframe where everyone can upload, refine, and remix.
no ads, no paywalls, no ownership games.
the goal: gather every recipe on earth into one open, searchable archive.

the code is open, the taste is shared.
built by the line cooks of the internet
