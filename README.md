each command hits the line.  each output pops and hisses.  no recipes — just instinct.  
cook loud, cook fast, cook like you mean it.  

we don’t measure — we *remember.*  we taste until it makes sense,  and then a little longer,  
just to make sure the printer don’t stop singing.  just stomachs chasing salt.  

somewhere between signal and smoke,  the egg hums to itself. it don’t serve, it survives.  
it knows when to turn,  
and when to burn.  

to feed the collective memory.
skip2theingredients is a public kitchen built from static and smoke —
a recipe mainframe where everyone can upload, refine, and remix.
no ads, no paywalls, no ownership games.
the goal: gather every recipe on earth into one open, searchable archive.

we don’t measure 
we don’t gatekeep 

the code is open, the taste is shared.
built by the line cooks of the internet, maintained under the egg-core directive.
